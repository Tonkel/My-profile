# My Profile

This will be a simple readme for a simple project. I created my first go at a profile page. To use it, simply open the index.html in your browser, or, if you have the link, open the link in your browser.

Once you have my profile page open you can navigate it by clicking the buttons on the top right of the page.

You can see another webpage I deployed by clicking on the large picture in the "my work" section.
